# sicp-2019
Some of the fruits of taking David Beazley's SICP course in Summer, 2019: https://www.dabeaz.com/sicp.html.

We're spending a week. going through [this book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html), which usually takes half a semester so I'm throwing up a bunch of potentially uncommented (and occasionally poorly formed) code solutions to exercises in the book (and some of Dave's exercises).
